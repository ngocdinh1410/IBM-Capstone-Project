The IBM Capstone Github consisted of all my files leading to the completion of IBM'S DATASCIENCE CERTIFICATE.


[Week 2 Project](https://github.com/ngocdinh1410/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Capstone%20Project_Week%202.ipynb)
In week 2, I did the following:

<li>Scraped the Toronto neighborhood/district table from Wikipedia using BeautifulSoup</li>



[Week 3 Project](https://github.com/ngocdinh1410/IBM-Capstone-Project/blob/master/Capstone%20Project_Week%203.ipynb)
<li>Clustered Toronto neighborhoods using K-means clusters</li>
<li>Analyzed the clusters</li>

In Week 4, I also executed my capstone project. Due to limited data and difficulty in execution, I changed my idea to focus on NYC crime data.
